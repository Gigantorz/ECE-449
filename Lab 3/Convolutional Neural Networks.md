- build to invariance to certain variations shifting, illumination....
- Deal with very high dimensional inputs without the need of large number of parameters
- Instead of learning to detect the whole image, detect smaller fragments in the image.

CNNs are the most effective algorithms known for image classification / computer vision. While CNNs have been applied to many other problems, image classification is in fact what they were originally designed for in [1]. Tensorflow, and its companion library Keras, are one of the most important platforms for training CNNs and other deep learning algorithms.
